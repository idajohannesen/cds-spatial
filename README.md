# Clustering of Danish in the United States: A Spatial Analysis Project

## Short description:
This repository contains a project carried out as part of the exam for the Spatial Analytics course at Aarhus University. The project aims to investigate the relationship between Danes immigrating to the United States in 1920 and the amount of people speaking Danish in the United States in 2009. The analysis looks for clustering of Danish immigrants and Danish speakers. This is done by first creating visualizations of the data, then calculating Moran's I by finding the nearest neighbors for each state, and lastly running a Monte Carlo simulation. 

## Repository structure:
The repository uses the following structure. 
|Folder name|Description|
|---|---|
|```data```|A folder containing the necessary datasets and geometries to run the code.|
|```code```|A folder containing the script in an Rmarkdown format and an html format.|
|```visualizations```|Maps saved as pngs.|

The repository also includes a file called ```LICENSE```. This is the license used for the project.

## Reproducing:
To reproduce the project's results, the contents of the repository can either be downloaded as a zip file or cloned through the command line. 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/idajohannesen/cds-spatial.git
```
Afterwards, the ```code``` folder's Rmarkdown file can be opened and run. It uses the data found in the ```data``` folder and therefore requires that the repository structure follows the structure specified above.
