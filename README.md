The repository uses the following structure.

|```visualizations```|Maps saved as pngs.|
|```LICENSE```|The license used for the project.|

## Reproducing:
To reproduce the project's results, the contents of the repository can either be downloaded as a zip file or cloned through the command line. 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/idajohannesen/cds-spatial.git

Afterwards, the ```code``` folder's Rmarkdown file can be opened and run. It uses the data found in the ```data``` folder and therefore requires that the repository structure follows the structure specified above.
